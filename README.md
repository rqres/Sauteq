# recipe-ai

A recipe generator built with the OpenAI API, Next.js 13, PocketBase, Tailwind CSS and Fuse.js (for fuzzy searching).

## Usage

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

## TODO:

- [x] Update loading skeleton when generating new recipe
- [ ] Display selected ingredients in generated recipe document differently (maybe somewhere on the side)
- [ ] Add functionality for adding new items to the ingredient DB if the search misses
- [ ] Change default ingredients displayed
- [x] Handle `\n`'s in GPT responses
- [x] Create generated recipes UI
- [ ] Implement Auth
